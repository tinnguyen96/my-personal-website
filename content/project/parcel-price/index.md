Using [Bostonâ€™s property assessment data](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment), I built a prediction system for the price of a land parcel using its physical attributes. 
Stakeholders who might use the predictions are the city of Boston itself (to determine property tax) and homeowners (to find a fair value for their purchase).
I used pandas to manipulate csvs, sklearn to preprocess (removing outliers, imputing missing features) and cross-validate, and finall LightGBM to fit learner. 
On single-household residences, the system is reasonably accurate: the average absolute percentage error is about 25%. 
The most important predictive feature is the total living area.
