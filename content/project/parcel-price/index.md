Using Bostonâ€™s property assessment data, I built a prediction system for the price of a land parcel.

Stakeholders who might use the predictions are the city of Boston itself (to determine property tax) and homeowners (to find a fair value for their purchase).

I used pandas to manipulate csvs, sklearn to preprocess (removing outliers, imputing missing features) and cross validate, LightGBM to fit learner. 

The built system is reasonably accurate: the average absolute percentage error is only 15%.
